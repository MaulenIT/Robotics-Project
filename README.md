# Implement Dead-reckoning localization and motion control for differential-drive mobile robot. 

For motion control, proceed with point stabilization problem (with 2 goal points). Implement also short-term reactive navigation (obstacle avoidance). You can use Matlab or Python to simulate your autonomous system.
